## WordPress Cluster Topology

Upon the package installation, a new environment with the following topology will be created: 

* **[Premium CDN](https://jelastic.com/blog/enterprise-cdn-verizon-integration/)** integration in order to provide Lightning-fast static assets loading  
* Either **[LiteSpeed ADC](https://docs.jelastic.com/litespeed-web-adc)** or **[NGINX](https://docs.jelastic.com/tcp-load-balancing)** load balancer is used for distributing the incoming traffic within a cluster  
* **Web Application Firewall** will be enabled by the default if **[LiteSpeed Web Server](https://docs.jelastic.com/litespeed-web-server)** will be installed
* The *WordPress* application itself is handled by either **LiteSpeed Web Server** or **[NGINX PHP](https://docs.jelastic.com/nginx-php)** servers with preconfigured [automatic horizontal scaling](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-horizontal-scaling) to handle load spikes  
* **Redis** is high-performance RAM-allocated data structure store used as a highspeed caching solution
* **[Shared Storage](https://docs.jelastic.com/shared-storage-container)** is mounted to all application server nodes for sharing common data  
* Highly-available **[MariaDB Galera Cluster](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/mysql-cluster#mariadb-galera-cluster)** is used to store and operate user data
